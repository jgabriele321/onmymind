# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
- Project is a Telegram bot (MindBot) that has been refactored from WhatsApp to phone calls using Twilio
- Need to set up proper project configuration and protection

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need proper .gitignore to exclude sensitive files and development artifacts
- Need to implement branch protection for code safety

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create .gitignore file
   - Success Criteria: File created with proper exclusions for:
     - Environment files (.env)
     - Build artifacts
     - IDE/Editor specific files
     - Dependency directories
     - Logs and temporary files

2. Set up branch protection
   - Success Criteria:
     - Main branch is protected
     - Status checks must pass before merging
     - Only repository owner can bypass rules
     - Protection rules are verified through GitHub API
   - Implementation Steps:
     a. Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI âœ“
     b. Configure branch protection rules
     c. Verify protection is working

## Project Status Board
- [x] Create and implement .gitignore file
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Test branch protection

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Completed: Created comprehensive .gitignore file with exclusions for:
  - Environment variables (.env files)
  - Go-specific files and directories
  - IDE and OS specific files
  - Build artifacts and logs
  - Twilio specific files
  - Debug and test coverage files
- Completed: Created GitHub Actions workflow (ci.yml) that:
  - Runs on push/PR to main branch
  - Checks if code builds
  - Runs tests
  - Uses proper environment secrets
- Next: Set up branch protection rules requiring CI checks to pass

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Before proceeding with branch protection setup, please:
1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
   - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
   - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
   - TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
2. Push the current changes to GitHub so we can enable branch protection with the CI workflow

## Lessons
- Environment variables should be properly protected and not committed to repository
- CI checks should verify both build and test success
